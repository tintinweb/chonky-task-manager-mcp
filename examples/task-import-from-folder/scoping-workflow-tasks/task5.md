  **Step 2.2: Architecture Pattern Recognition**
  1. **Load chonky-task-master task** "Architecture Analysis"
  2. **Create subtasks for pattern analysis** (state tracking via tasks only):

  **Thinking Process Required:**
  Based on the files discovered, I need to identify what type of system this is:
  - Smart contracts (DeFi protocols, NFT systems, DAO governance)
  - MetaMask Snap applications (wallet extensions, protocol integrations)
  - Web applications (frontend/backend architectures)

  This classification will guide the depth and focus of my analysis.

     **Create subtask** "System Pattern Identification":
     - Analyze discovered file patterns for system type
     - Identify if smart contracts, MetaMask Snap, web app, or multi-component
     - Determine primary architectural paradigm
     - Update subtask with system pattern classification

     **Create subtask** "Architectural Pattern Analysis":
     - For smart contracts: Identify DeFi, NFT, DAO, governance patterns
     - For MetaMask Snaps: Identify wallet extension, protocol integration patterns
     - For web applications: Identify frontend/backend, API, database patterns
     - For multi-component: Map component relationships and boundaries
     - Update subtask with detailed pattern analysis

     **Create subtask** "Component Relationship Mapping":
     - Map relationships between identified components
     - Identify inter-component communication patterns
     - Document component dependencies and integrations
     - Update subtask with relationship mapping results

  3. **Update main task** "Architecture Analysis" with comprehensive architecture classification and component understanding

successCriteria: |
  - System pattern identification completed with clear classification
  - Architectural pattern analysis completed for identified system type
  - Component relationship mapping completed with detailed documentation
  - Architecture analysis comprehensive and ready for metrics phase
