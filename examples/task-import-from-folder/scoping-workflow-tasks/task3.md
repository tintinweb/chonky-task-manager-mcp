  **Step 1.2: Project Type Identification**
  1. **Create chonky-task-master task** "Project Type Identification"
  2. **Perform initial assessment** from available context

  **Thinking Process Required:**
  I need to understand the project structure first before determining what tools to use. The project type will dictate which analysis tools are most appropriate and what the scoping focus should be.

  3. **Update task with project classification** as notes

  **Classification Process:**
  - Examine file structure and patterns for technology indicators
  - Identify primary programming languages and frameworks
  - Determine system architecture type (smart contracts, web app, etc.)
  - Document classification rationale and supporting evidence

successCriteria: |
  - Initial project assessment completed from available context
  - Project classification documented with clear rationale
  - Technology identification completed and verified
  - Classification notes comprehensive and well-documented
