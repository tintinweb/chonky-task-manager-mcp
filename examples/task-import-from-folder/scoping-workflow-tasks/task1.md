  **Step 0.1: Initialize Scoping Project**
  1. **Create chonky-task-master project** "Codebase Scoping - [PROJECT_NAME]"
  2. **Set project context** in chonky-task-master: workspace path, initial assessment
  3. **Create initial task** "Pre-Scoping Setup" with subtasks:
     - Initialize scoping tracking
     - Create scoping plan
     - Set up analysis strategy

  **Critical Requirements:**
  - Establish the scoping foundation by creating a chonky-task-master project
  - Understanding the project structure
  - Determine the appropriate analysis tools and create a comprehensive scoping strategy

successCriteria: |
  - Chonky-task-master project created successfully with proper naming
  - Project context clearly documented in task notes
  - Initial assessment completed with preliminary observations
  - Analysis strategy framework established
  - All subtasks created and ready for execution
