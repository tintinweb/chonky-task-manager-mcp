  **Step 3.4: Complexity and Risk Assessment**
  1. **Load chonky-task-master task** "Complexity Assessment"
  2. **Create subtasks for systematic complexity analysis** (task-based state management only):

  **Thinking Process Required:**
  System complexity affects audit effort and approach. I need to consider:
  - Code complexity (cyclomatic complexity, architectural complexity)
  - Integration complexity (external dependencies, multi-chain interactions)
  - Business logic complexity (DeFi mechanisms, governance systems)
  - Security complexity (permission systems, upgrade patterns)

  This will help provide accurate effort estimation.

     **Create subtask** "Code Complexity Analysis":
     - Assess codebase size and structural complexity
     - Evaluate cyclomatic complexity and maintainability metrics
     - Analyze architectural complexity and component relationships
     - Update subtask with code complexity assessment

     **Create subtask** "Integration Complexity Analysis":
     - Identify external integrations and dependencies
     - Assess multi-chain or cross-protocol interactions
     - Evaluate third-party service dependencies
     - Update subtask with integration complexity findings

     **Create subtask** "Business Logic Complexity Analysis":
     - Analyze business logic sophistication and complexity
     - Evaluate DeFi mechanisms, governance systems, or equivalent complexity
     - Assess mathematical operations and financial logic
     - Update subtask with business logic complexity assessment

     **Create subtask** "Security Complexity Analysis":
     - Evaluate security mechanism sophistication
     - Assess permission systems and access control complexity
     - Analyze upgrade patterns and administrative functions
     - Update subtask with security complexity findings

     **Create subtask** "Risk Area Identification":
     - Identify high-risk areas requiring focused audit attention
     - Prioritize risk areas by potential impact and likelihood
     - Map risk areas to audit effort requirements
     - Update subtask with comprehensive risk area analysis

  3. **Update main task** "Complexity Assessment" with complete complexity and risk analysis for effort estimation
