  **System Pattern Identification Subtask:**
  - Analyze discovered file patterns for system type
  - Identify if smart contracts, MetaMask Snap, web app, or multi-component
  - Determine primary architectural paradigm
  - Update subtask with system pattern classification

  **Pattern Analysis Process:**
  - Examine file structure patterns for technology indicators
  - Classify system as smart contracts, MetaMask Snap, web application, or hybrid
  - Identify primary architectural paradigms (layered, microservices, monolithic, etc.)
  - Document classification rationale with supporting evidence

successCriteria: |
  - File patterns analyzed systematically for system type indicators
  - System type classification completed with clear identification
  - Primary architectural paradigm determined and documented
  - Classification rationale provided with supporting evidence
