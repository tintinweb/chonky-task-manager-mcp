  **Tool Strategy Planning Subtask:**
  - Plan chonky-workspace-find_files usage for file discovery
  - Plan chonky-solidity-metrics-analyze_solidity_files_get_overview (if Solidity)
  - Plan chonky-metamask-snap-analysis (if MetaMask Snap)
  - Plan chonky-solidity-deployable-contracts (if Solidity)
  - Plan chonky-solidity-metrics-get_contract_call_graph (if complex Solidity)
  - Plan chonky-solidity-metrics-get_contract_inheritance_graph (if inheritance)
  - Update subtask with tool selection strategy

  **Strategic Tool Selection:**
  - Match tools to identified project type and complexity
  - Plan tool execution sequence for optimal analysis flow
  - Document tool configuration requirements and parameters
  - Establish tool output integration strategy for comprehensive analysis

successCriteria: |
  - Complete tool selection strategy documented
  - Tool execution sequence planned and documented
  - Tool configurations and parameters specified
  - Integration strategy established for tool outputs
