details: |
  **Solidity File Discovery Subtask:**
  - Use chonky-workspace-find_files with `**/*.sol` pattern
  - Exclude tests, scripts, interfaces from scope
  - Count and classify discovered Solidity files
  - Update subtask with Solidity file results

  **Systematic Discovery Process:**
  - Execute comprehensive file pattern matching for .sol files
  - Filter out test files, deployment scripts, and interface-only contracts
  - Classify by contract type (main contracts, libraries, abstract contracts)
  - Document file locations, sizes, and initial classification

successCriteria: |
  - Complete Solidity file discovery executed with pattern matching
  - Test files and scripts properly excluded from analysis scope
  - File count and classification documented comprehensively
  - Results updated in task notes for integration with main task
