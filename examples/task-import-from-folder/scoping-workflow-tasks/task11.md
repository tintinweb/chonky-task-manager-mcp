  **Step 4.2: Final Validation and Completeness**
  1. **Load chonky-task-master task** "Final Validation"
  2. **Create subtasks for comprehensive validation** (task-based validation only):

     **Create subtask** "Cross-Reference Validation":
     - Cross-reference all findings between chonky-task-master task notes
     - Verify consistency across all analysis phases
     - Identify and resolve any discrepancies in task findings
     - Update subtask with cross-reference validation results

     **Create subtask** "Completeness Verification":
     - Verify completeness against validation checklist using task data:
       - [ ] All project files discovered and categorized (from file discovery tasks)
       - [ ] Architecture and components fully mapped (from architecture tasks)
       - [ ] Security scope clearly defined (from security analysis tasks)
       - [ ] Complexity assessment completed with justification (from complexity tasks)
       - [ ] Effort estimation provided (from effort estimation tasks)
       - [ ] SCOPING_REPORT.md contains all required sections (from report generation task)
     - Update subtask with completeness verification results

     **Create subtask** "Quality Assurance Check":
     - Review SCOPING_REPORT.md for completeness and accuracy
     - Verify all sections populated with task-derived content
     - Confirm professional language and executive accessibility
     - **CRITICAL QA**: Go through ALL tasks and notes in short batches, verify that all relevant information for the scoping report is in SCOPING_REPORT.md
     - Check each task's findings against corresponding report sections to ensure complete information transfer
     - Update subtask with quality assurance results

     **Create subtask** "Project Completion":
     - Update task with final completion status and summary
     - Confirm all deliverables created and stored in task manager
     - Mark scoping workflow as completed with success criteria met
     - Update subtask with project completion confirmation

  3. **Update main task** "Final Validation" with comprehensive validation completion
  4. **Complete chonky-task-master project** with scoping workflow completion and all deliverables confirmed

successCriteria: |
  - Cross-reference validation completed with consistency verification
  - Completeness verification completed against full validation checklist
  - Quality assurance check completed with critical batch review
  - Project completion confirmed with all deliverables and success criteria met
