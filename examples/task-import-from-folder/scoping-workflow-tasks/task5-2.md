  **Architectural Pattern Analysis Subtask:**
  - For smart contracts: Identify DeFi, NFT, DAO, governance patterns
  - For MetaMask Snaps: Identify wallet extension, protocol integration patterns
  - For web applications: Identify frontend/backend, API, database patterns
  - For multi-component: Map component relationships and boundaries
  - Update subtask with detailed pattern analysis

  **Technology-Specific Pattern Analysis:**
  - Smart Contracts: Analyze for DeFi protocols, NFT systems, DAO governance, proxy patterns
  - MetaMask Snaps: Identify wallet extensions, protocol integrations, permission models
  - Web Applications: Map frontend/backend separation, API patterns, database interactions
  - Multi-component: Document cross-component communication and integration patterns

successCriteria: |
  - Technology-specific pattern analysis completed thoroughly
  - Architectural patterns identified and documented with examples
  - Pattern complexity assessed for each identified pattern
  - Detailed pattern analysis integrated with system understanding
