  **Step 3.2: Security Architecture Mapping**
  1. **Load chonky-task-master task** "Security Architecture Analysis"
  2. **Create subtasks for comprehensive security mapping** (tasks track all state):

  **Thinking Process Required:**
  I need to understand the security-relevant aspects of this system:
  - What are the main components and how do they interact?
  - Where are the trust boundaries and security perimeters?
  - What are the potential attack surfaces?
  - How do different actors interact with the system?

  This analysis will form the foundation for the security audit scope.

     **Create subtask** "Component and Interaction Mapping":
     - Identify key system components from previous analysis
     - Map component relationships and interaction patterns
     - Document component responsibilities and capabilities
     - Update subtask with component mapping results

     **Create subtask** "Trust Boundary Analysis":
     - Map trust boundaries and security perimeters
     - Identify where trust assumptions change
     - Document security boundaries between components
     - Update subtask with trust boundary analysis

     **Create subtask** "Attack Surface Identification":
     - Identify external-facing interfaces and entry points
     - Map potential attack vectors and access paths
     - Assess attack surface complexity and exposure
     - Update subtask with attack surface analysis

     **Create subtask** "Security Mechanism Analysis":
     - Identify access control mechanisms
     - Analyze authentication and authorization patterns
     - Review input validation and sanitization approaches
     - Update subtask with security mechanism findings

  3. **Update main task** "Security Architecture Analysis" with comprehensive security architecture understanding

successCriteria: |
  - Component and interaction mapping completed with detailed documentation
  - Trust boundary analysis completed with security perimeter identification
  - Attack surface identification completed with comprehensive assessment
  - Security mechanism analysis completed with detailed findings
